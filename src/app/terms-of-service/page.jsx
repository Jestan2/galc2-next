These Global Terms and Conditions (this “Agreement”) constitute a legally binding agreement between each User (“you” or “your”) and The Great American Labor Company (“Great American Labor”) governing use of Great American Labor’s website and platform, more particularly described in Section 1 below (collectively referred to herein as the “Platform”).

This Agreement governs your access to and use of the Platform. This Agreement may also include other supplemental policies and terms referenced and/or linked to within this Agreement or which are otherwise made available to you, all of which also apply to your use of the Platform and are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.

SECTION 16 CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST GREAT AMERICAN LABOR TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.


1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATFORM. The Platform is an online web-based two-sided marketplace which enables connections between Clients and Laborers. Clients are individuals and/or businesses seeking to obtain short-term services (“Jobs”). “Laborer(s)” are individuals and/or businesses seeking to perform Jobs for Clients. Clients and Laborers are referred to herein together as “User(s)”.

Laborers are independent business owners, providing services under their own name or business name (and not under the Platform’s name), using their own tools and supplies. Laborers may (a) maintain a clientele without any restrictions from the Platform; (b) offer and provide their services elsewhere, including through competing platforms; and (c) accept or reject Clients and Jobs. Laborers are independent contractors of Clients, not the Platform.

Any reference to a Laborer being licensed or credentialed in some manner, or being “badged”, “reliable”, “elite”, “great value”, “background checked”, “vetted” (or similar language) indicates only that the Laborer has completed a relevant registration process with the Platform or met certain criteria and does not, and shall not be deemed to, represent anything else. Any such description: (i) is intended to be useful information for Clients to evaluate when they make their own decisions about the identity and suitability of Laborers whom they select or interact, or contract with via the Platform; and (ii) is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by the Platform of a Laborer’s skills or qualifications or whether they are licensed, insured, trustworthy, safe or suitable.

Notwithstanding any feature or service of the Platform that a Client may use to expedite Laborer selection, the Client is responsible for determining the Job and selecting or otherwise approving their Laborer and should undertake their own research prior to booking any Job to be satisfied that a specific Laborer has the right qualifications. Laborers, not the Platform, are solely responsible for the quality, timeliness and consequences of their work, and Clients’ recourse for any deficiencies with such work are exclusively against the Laborer, not the Platform.


2. THE GREAT AMERICAN LABOR COMPANY’S ROLE. Great American Labor is not an employment agency service or business, and Great American Labor is not an employer of any User. Users are not employees, partners, representatives, agents, joint venturers, independent contractors or franchisees of Great American Labor. Users hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) Great American Labor does not (i) perform Jobs nor employ individuals to perform Jobs, (ii) supervise, scope, direct, control or monitor Laborers’ work (including that Great American Labor does not set Laborers’ work locations, work hours, or terms of work), nor provide tools or supplies to, or pay any expenses of, Laborers, or (iii) have any control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of Jobs or Users (or the acts or omissions thereof), nor of the integrity, responsibility, competence, qualifications, communications, or the ratings or reviews provided by Users with respect to each other. Users do not have authority to, and may not act as agent for, nor bind or make any representations on behalf of, Great American Labor (including that Laborers may not modify all or any part of the Platform fees.

Great American Labor is neither responsible nor liable for workers’ compensation or any tax payment or withholding, including applicable sales taxes, HST/QST/GST/PST, unemployment or employment insurance, Canada Pension Plan, disability insurance, applicable VAT, National Insurance, employer’s liability, employer training tax, social security contributions, PAYE or other applicable payroll withholdings in connection with a User’s use of the Platform, or personal income tax. The Laborer assumes full and sole responsibility for all required and applicable income tax and social contributions such as Social Security or National Insurance Contribution withholdings as to the Laborer and all persons engaged by the Laborer in the performance of the Job. Each User assumes all liability for proper classification of such User’s workers based on applicable legal guidelines.


3. USER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. In your access to and use of the Platform, you represent and warrant that you:

will comply fully with the terms of this Agreement;
are at least of the legally required age in the jurisdiction in which you reside, and are otherwise capable of entering into binding contracts;
have the right, authority and capacity to enter into this Agreement (including that you have the right and authority to act on behalf of, and bind to this Agreement, any company or organization on whose behalf you are entering into this Agreement);
will only request and/or perform (as applicable) Jobs in the United States;
will respect the privacy (including private, family and home life), property, and data protection rights of Users and will not record (whether through video, audio or otherwise) any Job or any interaction by or with any User and/or Great American Labor without obtaining the prior written consent of Great American Labor and the relevant User, in each instance;
will act professionally and responsibly in your interactions with, and fulfill the commitments you make to, other Users (including by communicating clearly and promptly, and being present and/or available at the time you agree upon with other Users);
will comply with all applicable local, state, provincial, national, or international laws in your use of the Platform;
will not use the Platform for the purchase, sale or delivery of alcohol or any controlled or illegal substances or services; and
will ensure that all communications regarding Jobs (including scoping and payments and any questions relevant to Jobs), remain in your records before, during and after the Job.


4. ADDITIONAL LABORER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. If you are a Laborer, you additionally represent and warrant that, in your access to and use of the Platform, you:

are operating as a sole proprietor, partnership, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, corporation or other business entity when using the Platform;
are customarily engaged in an independently established business of the same nature as the services performed for Clients through the Platform, and maintain an independent clientele;
have the unrestricted right to work in the jurisdiction in which you perform Jobs;
have and will maintain (at your own expense) any licenses, permits, and/or registrations required by applicable laws that apply to your performance of Jobs (including, as applicable, a business license, business tax registration, and/or contractor’s license);
have and will maintain all insurance required to operate your business and perform the Jobs;
will respond to invitations promptly; provide timely, high-quality services for your Clients; only offer and provide Jobs for which you have the necessary expertise to perform; and perform the Jobs as agreed upon with your Client in a safe manner; and
will promptly disclose to the Platform in writing if you have any potentially relevant criminal convictions (other than minor fixed penalty parking or speeding offenses) that arise during your use of the Platform.


5. LABORER ONBOARDING.

(a) Background Checks. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Laborers may be subject to a review process before they can register on, and during their use of, the Platform, which may include identity verification and criminal background checks, using third party services as appropriate (“Background Check(s)”). If you are a Laborer, to the extent permitted under applicable law, you agree to undergo such Background Checks. Great American Labor cannot, and does not, assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or reliability of Background Check information, nor for any false or misleading statements made by Users of the Platform.

(b) Professional Licensing. Great American Labor does not independently verify that Laborers have the necessary expertise, or have obtained any licenses, permits, or registrations required, to perform their Jobs. It may be unlawful to perform certain types of Jobs without a license, permit and/or registration, and performing same may result in law enforcement action and/or penalties or fines. Laborers are solely responsible for avoiding such prohibited Jobs. If you have questions about how national, state, provincial, territorial and/or local laws apply to your Jobs on the Platform, you should first seek appropriate legal guidance. Clients are solely responsible for determining if a Laborer has the skills and qualifications necessary to perform the specific Job and confirming that the Laborer has obtained all required licenses, permits, or registrations, if any. Clients may wish to consult their national, state, provincial, territorial and/or local law requirements to determine whether certain Jobs are required to be performed by a licensed or otherwise registered professional.


6. OTHER PARTIES. Where approved in advance by the Client for the Job, Laborers may engage assistants, helpers, subcontractors or other personnel (“Laborer Assistant(s)”) to perform all or any part of a Job; provided that such Laborer Assistants have registered through the Platform and meet all of the requirements applicable to the Laborer as set out in this Agreement. The Laborer assumes full and sole responsibility for the acts and omissions of all Laborer Assistants used in its performance of Jobs and is fully responsible for: (a) the lawful payment of all compensation, benefits and expenses for its Laborer Assistants, (b) all required and applicable tax withholdings as to such Laborer Assistants, and (c) ensuring all Laborer Assistants are registered Laborers on the Platform.

The Client agrees that if they have authorized someone other than the Client to book a Job on their behalf or to be present in their stead when the Job is performed, the Client is appointing that person as their agent (“Client Agent(s)”), and the Client is deemed to have granted to the Client Agent the authority to act as their agent in relation to the applicable Job. Client Agents may direct or instruct the Laborer’s performance of the Job, and the Laborer may follow such direction as if the direction was given by the Client. The Client assumes full and sole responsibility for the acts and omissions of Client Agents.


7. DEACTIVATION AND SUSPENSION. In the event of an actual or suspected breach by you of any part of this Agreement, or if your conduct poses a risk to Great American Labor or the Platform (including abuse, fraud or interference with the proper working of the Platform), Great American Labor may (a) suspend your right to use the Platform pending its investigation; and/or (b) deactivate your account or limit your use of the Platform, until the issue is resolved to Great American Labor’s reasonable satisfaction. Great American Labor will provide you with written notice of its determination to deactivate or suspend your account and the basis for such deactivation or suspension. If you wish to appeal any determination made by Great American Labor pursuant to this Section, please contact us here within 14 days of receipt of such notice with the grounds for your appeal. If Great American Labor suspends or deactivates your account or limits your use of the Platform pursuant to this Section, you may not register and/or create a new account under different usernames, identities or contact details (whether under your or any other name or business name), even if you are acting on behalf of a third party. Even after your right to use the Platform is suspended, terminated or limited, this Agreement will remain enforceable against you.


8. PAYMENTS. The Client will pay fees to the Platform for facilitating the booking of Jobs. Payments will be made as follows: a pre-determined deposit per Laborer to accompany this Agreement paid directly by the Client to the Platform as part of the booking process, as well as a credit card processing fee. The Client will further pay the balance due at an hourly rate for a minimum of two (2) hours for each Laborer, paid directly by the Client to the Laborer. No other fees and/or expenses will be paid to the Platform, unless such fees and/or expenses have been approved in advance by the Client. The Laborer, as an independent contractor, shall be solely responsible for any and all taxes, Social Security contributions or payments, disability insurance, worker’s compensation insurance, unemployment taxes, and other payroll type taxes applicable to such compensation.

The Platform has the right of control over the method of payment for services through its payment processing partner, Stripe. By booking online with the Platform, the Client is agreeing to the Stripe Services Agreement, located at https://stripe.com/legal/ssa. Additionally, the Client is authorizing its payment method to be charged for amounts owed to the Platform using debit or credit cards. Regarding payment disputes, all requests for chargebacks, errors, claims, refunds, and disputes will be subject to review by the Platform in accordance with the rules applicable to the payment method used. The Platform may initiate a collection process or legal action for fraudulently submitted disputes with the Client’s financial institution. Client agrees to pay all costs incurred to take such action, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

Great American Labor may terminate this Agreement between you and Great American Labor at any time, and cease providing access to the Platform, (i) immediately, if you breach any part of this Agreement, or if you violate applicable laws, or (ii) upon thirty (30) days prior written notice, for any reason or no reason. Great American Labor reserves the right to take appropriate legal action pursuant to this Agreement.

Notice of such amendments may be given by posting such updates or modifications (or notice thereof) on the Platform, by e-mail or in any other reasonable manner; and the amendments will be effective upon such posting.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such modifications and/or updates are material, you will be informed in advance (in the manner set out in this Section) for your acceptance or rejection.

To the extent permitted by law, Great American Labor shall not be liable to you for any updates, upgrades, modifications to or discontinuance of all or any portion of the Platform.


15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION. To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to, arising from or regarding your use of the Platform, your relationship with Great American Labor, Jobs, or this Agreement (including previous versions), (“Dispute”), you can try to find an amicable solution with Great American Labor before initiating any out of court settlement (such as mediation or arbitration) or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Great American Labor’s address for providing such notice is rob@greatamericanlabor.com.


16. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY — IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND GREAT AMERICAN LABOR CAN BRING CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (“ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”). THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND GREAT AMERICAN LABORTO SUBMIT CLAIMS TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.

BY ENTERING INTO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE, WITHOUT LIMITATION OR QUALIFICATION, TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND YOU ACCEPT ALL OF ITS TERMS.

(a) Agreement to Binding Arbitration. IN EXCHANGE FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE SPEEDY, ECONICAL, AND IMPARTIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE OF ARBITRATION, YOU AND GREAT AMERICAN LABORMUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF ALL DISPUTES OR CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AS SET FORTH HEREIN.

This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and your relationship with Great American Labor. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Great American Labor agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims (“Claim(s)”) relating to, arising from or regarding your use of the Platform, your relationship with Great American Labor, Jobs, or this Agreement (including previous versions), including Claims by Great American Labor, Claims against Great American Labor and Claims against Great American Labor’s Affiliates (including its parent company).

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, this includes Claims related to payments, any city, county, state or federal wage and hour law, compensation, meal or rest breaks, expense reimbursement, wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, retaliation, fraud, defamation, trade secrets, unfair competition, personal injury, property damage or loss, emotional distress, any promotions or offers made by Great American Labor, or the threatened or actual suspension or deactivation of your account; breach of any express or implied contract or breach of any express or implied covenant; claims arising under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims arising under antitrust laws; claims arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; claims arising under the Fair Labor Standards Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Defend Trade Secrets Act, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for individual claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by Great American Labor and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or funded by insurance), and state or local statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters; and all other federal, state or local statutory and common law claims.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND GREAT AMERICAN LABOR ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS, UNLESS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO REQUIRE ARBITRATION OF EVERY CLAIM OR DISPUTE THAT CAN LAWFULLY BE ARBITRATED, EXCEPT THOSE CLAIMS AND DISPUTES THAT, BY THE TERMS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, ARE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE.

(b) Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief. Except as otherwise required under applicable law, you and Great American Labor agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Claim between Great American Labor (and/or, if applicable, its Affiliates) and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND GREAT AMERICAN LABOR ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (“Class Action Waiver”). Further, unless both you and Great American Labor otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (i) the Claim is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (ii) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as to any Claims, then those Claims shall be severed from any remaining Claims and may remain in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims to the fullest extent possible.

(c) Rules and Logistics Governing Arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a Claim must be filed with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) must be provided to the other party. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the AAA Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated and modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement, and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a different set of AAA Rules. You and Great American Labor agree that the arbitration shall be administered before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if the parties cannot agree within thirty (30) days after names of potential arbitrators have been proposed, then by a single arbitrator who is chosen by the AAA.

As part of the arbitration, the parties will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim(s). The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual Claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s decision, which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based.

The arbitrator will decide the substance of all Claims in accordance with applicable law and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. Claims will be governed by their applicable statute of limitations and failure to demand arbitration within the prescribed time period shall bar the Claims as provided by law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

(d) Severability. In the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable under applicable law not preempted by the FAA, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.


17. NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Except as expressly set out herein and/or is otherwise required by applicable laws, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of Great American Labor and Users, and their permitted successors and assigns. There are no other third-party beneficiaries under this Agreement. None of the terms of this Agreement are enforceable by any persons who are not a party to this Agreement; provided, however, that Great American Labor may enforce any such provisions on behalf of its Affiliates.
